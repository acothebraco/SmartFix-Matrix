# DIY LED Matrix

A modular ESP32-S3 firmware for a DIY LED Matrix screen using a Waveshare ESP32-S3 RGB Matrix board and a 64×32 HUB75 RGB LED panel.

The display shows a custom DIY LED Matrix header, scrolling service text, pixel-art effects, random animations, configurable colors, brightness, WiFi settings, and OTA firmware updates from GitHub Releases. A GitHub Pages based web flasher is also included for easy USB installation directly from Chrome or Edge.

> Project status: active development / maker project.

## About

DIY LED Matrix is a custom ESP32-S3 HUB75 LED matrix project.
It runs on an ESP32-S3 with a HUB75 RGB LED matrix panel and displays a branded DIY LED Matrix header, scrolling service messages, pixel-art animations, and configurable visual effects.

The project is built with **PlatformIO** and the **Arduino framework** and is designed to be easy to maintain and extend.  
The firmware is split into multiple modules for display handling, animations, settings, WiFi, web configuration, and OTA updates.

The ESP32 creates its own configuration WiFi access point and can also connect to a home WiFi network.  
From the web interface, the display text, brightness, animation mode, logo/header effect, colors, WiFi settings, and GitHub OTA update URL can be changed without reflashing the device.

For first installation or recovery flashing, the project also provides a browser-based USB web flasher powered by ESP Web Tools and GitHub Pages.

The goal of this project is to create a reliable, upgradeable, and visually attractive LED sign for maker projects, pixel art, scrolling messages, effects, and workshop display use.

## Hardware

Tested target hardware:

- Waveshare ESP32-S3 RGB Matrix board
- Waveshare RGB Full-Color LED Matrix Panel P2.5 64×32
- HUB75 connection
- 5 V power supply for the LED matrix panel

Current display size:

```text
64 px wide × 32 px high
```

Panel expansion notes:

```text
1 × 64×32 panel  = 64×32
2 × 64×32 side-by-side = 128×32
2 × 64×32 stacked      = 64×64
4 × 64×32 as 2×2       = 128×64
```

## Firmware structure

The firmware is split into multiple source files so the project stays easy to maintain.

```text
src/
├── main.cpp
├── config.h
├── app_state.h
├── app_state.cpp
├── matrix_display.h
├── matrix_display.cpp
├── animations.h
├── animations.cpp
├── web_interface.h
├── web_interface.cpp
├── settings.h
├── settings.cpp
├── wifi_manager.h
├── wifi_manager.cpp
├── ota_update.h
└── ota_update.cpp
```

Main responsibilities:

```text
config.h              firmware version, panel size, default values
app_state.*           global app state and active settings
matrix_display.*      HUB75 setup, colors, DIY LED Matrix header drawing
animations.*          scrolling text, logo effects, pixel art, random FX
web_interface.*       configuration web page and routes
settings.*            Preferences / NVS load, save, factory reset
wifi_manager.*        access point, home WiFi, reconnect logic
ota_update.*          GitHub OTA update handling
main.cpp              small setup/loop entry point
```

---

## Build & flash with PlatformIO

Build the firmware:

```powershell
pio run
```

Flash over USB:

```powershell
pio run -t upload
```

Open serial monitor:

```powershell
pio device monitor
```

If upload does not start automatically, hold **BOOT**, tap **RESET**, then start upload again.

---

## Browser web flasher

DIY LED Matrix includes a GitHub Pages based web flasher for easy first-time USB flashing or recovery flashing without installing PlatformIO.

Web flasher page:


**https://acothebraco.github.io/DIY-LED-Matrix/**
```

Requirements:

- Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge on desktop
- USB data cable
- GitHub Pages enabled for this repository
- Browser permission to access the ESP32-S3 serial port

The web flasher uses the full USB image:

```text
DIY-LED-Matrix-usb.bin
```

It does **not** use the OTA binary. The OTA binary is only for firmware updates from the DIY LED Matrix web interface.

To enable the web flasher on GitHub:

```text
Repository → Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions
```

The GitHub Actions workflow builds the firmware and publishes the web flasher automatically after pushing to `main`.

---

## Generated firmware binaries

The project can generate two different `.bin` files inside the PlatformIO build folder:

```text
.pio/build/esp32-s3-rgb-matrix/DIY-LED-Matrix-ota.bin
.pio/build/esp32-s3-rgb-matrix/DIY-LED-Matrix-usb.bin
```

Use them like this:

```text
DIY-LED-Matrix-ota.bin = app-only firmware for OTA / web update
DIY-LED-Matrix-usb.bin = full flash image for USB / esptool
```

The normal PlatformIO upload command still works:

```powershell
pio run -t upload
```

For manual full USB flashing with esptool:

```powershell
python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 --port COM7 --baud 921600 write_flash 0x0 .pio\build\esp32-s3-rgb-matrix\DIY-LED-Matrix-usb.bin
```

Change `COM7` to your actual ESP32 serial port.

---

## Web configuration

On first use, the ESP32 creates a WiFi access point:

```text
SSID:     DIY-LED-Matrix
Password: diyled123
```

Connect your phone or computer to this WiFi and open:

```text
http://192.168.4.1/
```

The web interface can configure:

- Display mode
- Auto demo mode
- Brightness
- Scrolling text
- Scroll speed
- Text color
- Header/logo text
- Header/logo animation effect
- Home WiFi SSID and password
- OTA firmware URL
- Factory reset

Settings are saved on the ESP32 and restored after reboot.

---

## GitHub OTA update

OTA updates use the app-only binary:

```text
DIY-LED-Matrix-ota.bin
```

Recommended GitHub Release asset name:

```text
DIY-LED-Matrix-ota.bin
```

Example OTA URL:

```text
https://github.com/acothebraco/DIY-LED-Matrix/releases/latest/download/DIY-LED-Matrix-ota.bin
```

Important:

- The repository or release asset must be publicly reachable, or OTA needs authentication.
- Do not upload the full USB image as OTA firmware.
- OTA needs the app-only `.bin` file.

---

## Repository layout

```text
.github/workflows/     GitHub Actions workflows for Pages/web flasher
scripts/               helper scripts, binary export scripts
src/                   firmware source code

## Development workflow

Typical local workflow:

```powershell
git status
pio run
pio run -t upload
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your change"
git push
```

Create a release tag:

```powershell
git tag v1.2.0
git push origin v1.2.0
```

---

## Roadmap

Planned / possible future improvements:

- GitHub Actions release workflow for release assets
- Automatic upload of OTA and USB binaries to GitHub Releases
- More DIY LED Matrix header fonts
- More pixel-art animations
- Multi-panel support for 128×32 or 64×64
- Improved DIY LED Matrix pixel logo options
- Night mode / schedule-based brightness
